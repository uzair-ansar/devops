# What is a Computer Network?
- Communication between two or more network interfaces.

# Components of Computer Network
1. Two or more computer devices
2. Cables as link between the computers
3. A network intefacing card (NIC) on each device (Computers)
4. Switches
5. Routers
6. Software called OS - Operating System

# OSI Model
- People around the world uses computer network to communicate with each other
- For worldwide data communication, system must be developed which are compatible to communicate with each other
- There should be standard communication methods and devices
- ISO (International Organization of Stadardization) has developed this standard for network communication

OSI Model -> This communication model is called an Open System Interconnection OSI

# ISO - OSI model is a seven layer architecture
1. Physical              7. Application Layer
2. Datalink              6. Presentation Layer
3. Network               5. Session Layer
4. Transport             4. Transport Layer
5. Session               3. Network Layer
6. Presentation          2. Datalink Layer
7. Application           1. Physical Layer

# Basic elements of a layered model are:
"--> Services --> Protocols --> and Interface"

1. A service is a set of action that a layer offers to another (higher) layer
2. A protocol is a set of rules that a layer uses to exchange information
3. Interface is communication between the layers
